            <h2>A Glimpse over time</h2>
            <br>
            <p>There have been various studies and research about this certain topic
                <br>
                in the timeline of many years. Indeed, it is a crucial topic to study as it
                <br>
                involves the evolution of mankind from each generation to have ever lived. According to
                <br>
                The National Institutes of Health, many theories claim that fertility rate is inversely
                <br>
                proportional to lifespan(or vice versa); Increased lifespan leads to a reduced fertility. 
                <br>
                Interestingly enough, there had been some studies of organisms that supported those 
                <br>
                multiple theories, with the exception of HUMANS; Strange, it was...HOWEVER, only in the
                <br>
                case of historical populations. As for contemporary populations, the inverse proportion
                <br>
                was seen. Researchers suspected that it was due to genes.
                <br>
                Now, here come a few of the theories involved in this research:
            </p>
            <p>The antagonistic pleiotropy theory and the disposable soma theory.
                <br>
                Simply put, the antagonistic pleiotropy theory tells us that an increase in early reproductive
                <br>
                life would result to an increased risk of diseases and mortality later on. The disposable soma
                <br>
                theory is quite similar, except in focuses on how reproduction comes with energetic and 
                <br>
                metabolic costs which may lead to more serious conditions later on.
